## FireBase database

Patient data are stored in CloudFirestore database provided by Firebase services.
In order to connect the application to Firebase and develop admin access, following steps have to be performed:
- create a [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- add the Firebase Admin SDK to your server. Read [detailed documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup?authuser=0#java) for more information.
- create a CloudFirestore project. In **Project settings** --> **Service accounts** press ***Generate new private key***. Save the generated JSON file in root folder of your Java project.
- use private key JSON file and URL with name of your CloudFirestor to authenticate using [OAuth 2.0 refresh token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup?authuser=0#use-oauth-2-0-refresh-token)


## WebAplication for database management
Application provides easy access to the list of registered patients. Employee of laboratory can view entries and delete them, if needed.

# Covid-19 Data
COVID-19 data is being provided by [**Disease.sh - Open Disease data**](https://corona.lmao.ninja/)

Information about Covid-19 symptoms provided by [**covid19.gov.lv**](https://covid19.gov.lv/en/covid-19/about-covid-19/symptoms?fbclid=IwAR2Ugug4qbw0wmmxrjTxbTE5xdmDvNAs0nMVpVUqFT-kHpGpXZqwXHdpM2M)

# Future plans/potential for development
- creating chat-bots on other social network platforms (Twitter, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, etc.)
- improving application process for tests by adding option to reserve time and date directly through the chat-bot.
- increase functionality of webaplication - possibility to create separate lists of patients, based on urgency (or other factors).
